🔍 Analyze a Phishing Email Sample
📌 Objective
To analyze a suspicious email for signs of phishing by identifying key red flags such as spoofed addresses, misleading links, grammatical errors, and social engineering tactics.

🛠️ Tools Used
Email Client or saved email file (text format)

Free Online Email Header Analyzer

📧 Email Analysis Overview
🚩 Key Phishing Indicators Identified:
Suspicious Sender Address

Claims to be from Microsoft Account Team but uses non-Microsoft domains like phishing@pot.

Urgency and Social Engineering

Urgent prompts like “Report The User” create pressure for immediate action—a classic phishing tactic.

Misleading Links

Buttons like “Report The User” and “Unsubscribe” actually open your email client to send a message to a personal Gmail address, not to Microsoft.

Grammatical and Formatting Errors

Odd phrasing such as "Unusual sign.in activity" and misuse of punctuation signal lack of professionalism.

Generic Language

No personalization; mentions of “a user from Russia/Moscow” instead of account-specific details.

Tracking Pixel Embedded

A hidden 1×1 pixel from a third-party domain (thebandalisty.com) used for email tracking.

🔍 Header Analysis
Authentication Failures:

Missing SPF, DKIM, and DMARC records.

Indicates email forgery and potential spoofing.

Suspicious Email Path:

Email routed through unknown or unrelated domains like thcultarfdes.co.uk.

🧪 Final Verdict
The analyzed email is a highly suspicious phishing attempt with:

Fake sender and reply-to addresses

Misleading UI elements

Grammar and formatting inconsistencies

Embedded tracking tools

No genuine Microsoft URLs
